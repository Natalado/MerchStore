# MerchStore
An basic interactive web application to sell merchandise.

__Merch Store__

The idea I have is a basic one: an online merch store. The store itself may contain products like cups, clothing, key chains, and such like. The user will be able to pick out from the variety of options the store provides. The user will also be able to interact with each item to take a look at their descriptions.

__A Basic Description of the Merch Store__

The plan is to make an interface similar to that of Amazon. Users can scroll through a list of items found in the database, see a description of the item, and buy it. The database will display the amount of each item available. When an item is no longer available, the web app will automatically display the item as sold out or remove the item from view entirely. The descriptions will also be in the database. As the descriptions are altered in the database, they will also be automatically altered on the web app. The same idea will be implemented with prices.

Users will also be able to create an account to buy items displayed on the store. Their account and information will be added to the database. Their purchases will then also be stored into the database, as well as be seen in the web app so users can see what purchases they have been made. They will also be able to see the status of their order. If the status changes in the database, then the user will see the status of the order change on the web app. Users will also be given the option to add an item to their wishlist on their account. They will be able to go to their account, click on the wishlist item, and it will lead them straight to the product on the web app.

__Conclusion__

As mentioned earlier, this idea is a basic one. However, this is also the idea that most online stores have based their websites on. Although it is not new, I think learning to build a web app like this is important, considering how common this type of website is. For now, this is the idea that I have. Some feedback would be greatly appreciated!
